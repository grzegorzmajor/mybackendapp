# My Backend App

## Introduction
### First
This project was started as a backend for my website.
I needed to build my portfolio.
Instead of creating some Docker containers with prefabs, I decided to write the backend for my website myself in Java, gaining experience in the topics I've been learning for the last few months.
I wanted to understand what I was writing, so I put off writing tests for later. I wanted to focus on Spring, JPA and dependencies between entities. In the first phase, I limited the tests to manual ones using Postman.
